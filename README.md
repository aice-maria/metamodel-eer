# metamodel-eer
General Objective: Construct a metamodel that describes the ER model and elements of the model EER independent of the graphic definition. 
Specific objectives:
1. Determine the theoretical aspects necessary for the design of the desired metamodel.
2. Design a conceptual scheme that describes the ER model and its extensions.
3. Implement a metamodel using EMF that represents the elements described in the conceptual scheme

Abstract

Taking into account that the Entity-Relationship (ER) model and its extensions
(EER) is one of the high-level data model currently most popular for the modeling of
conceptual schemes for Database applications, it is useful to have a metamodel that
describes it and that can be independent of its graphic definition, thatâ€™s why this
perspective becomes the main objective of the present work. The presented metamodel
is described in an Ecore model of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), thus
enabling its link with GMF in order to generate graphic editors based on the proposed
definition.
